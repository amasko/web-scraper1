Old people, especially those who were young during The Great Depression, are utterly obsessed with getting free/discounted things and feel bad about throwing anything out. These types of companies are always setting up little tents outside of malls and parks trying to promote their shitty, hyper-branded cans of walmart-quality soda with an extra caffeine pill thrown in. The elderly will never pass one of these tents by without picking up as many free cans as possible.    They have no desire to actually drink it, but feel good about getting something for free. You probably made his day by drinking that, since now he feels good about helping his grandkid out.              permalink                                                    [+]    ClassicFlavour          11 points    12 points    13 points      3 hours ago      (8 children)          [  ]    ClassicFlavour          11 points    12 points    13 points      3 hours ago              Do you think that signature at the top was signed by a real pimp?              permalink                                          [+]    itim__office          40 points    41 points    42 points      3 hours ago      (4 children)          [  ]    itim__office          40 points    41 points    42 points      3 hours ago              Yes.
